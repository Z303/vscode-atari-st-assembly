**Bit Plane Control Register 0 (misc, control bits)**

|Bit| Function| Description  |
|---|---|---  |
|15| HIRES| HIRES = High resolution (640*200/640*400 interlace) mode  |
|14-12| BPUx| Bitplane use code 000-110 (NONE through 6 inclusive)  |
|11| HAM| Hold-and-modify mode(1 =Hold-and-modify mode) (0 =Extra Half Brite(EHB) mode,only if 6 bitplanes specified)  |
|10| DPF| Double playfield (PF1 = odd & PF2 = even bit planes) now available in all resolutions. (If BPU = 6 and HAM = 0 and DPF = 0 a special mode is defined that allows bitplane 6 to cause an intensity reduction of the other 5 bitplanes. The color register output selected by 5 bitplanes is shifted to half intensity by the 6th bit plane. This is called EXTRA-HALFBRITE Mode.  |
|09| COLOR| Enables color burst output signal  |
|08| GAUD| Genlock audio enable. This level appears on the ZD pin on denise during all blanking periods, unless ZDCLK bit is set.  |
|07| UHRES| Ultrahi res enables the UHRES pointers (for 1k*1k) also needs bits in DMACON (hires chips only). Disables hard stops for vert, horiz display windows.  |
|06| SHRES| Super hi-res mode (35ns pixel width)  |
|05| BYPASS=0| Bit planes are scrolled and prioritized normally, but bypass color table and 8 bit wide data appear on R(7:0).  |
|04| BPU3=0| See above (BPUx)  |
|03| LPEN| Light pen enable (reset on power up)  |
|02| LACE| Interlace enable (reset on power up)  |
|01| ERSY| External resync (HSYNC, VSYNC pads become inputs) (reset on power up)  |
|00| ECSENA=0| When low (default), the following bits in BPLCON3 are disabled: BRDRBLNK,BRDNTRAN,ZDCLKEN,BRDSPRT, and EXTBLKEN. These 5 bits can always be set by writing to BPLCON3, however there effects are inhibited until ECSENA goes high. This allows rapid context switching between pre-ECS viewports and new ones.|
