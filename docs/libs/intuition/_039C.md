**NAME**

LockLayerInfo -- Lock the LayerInfo structure.

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    LockLayerInfo( li )
                   a0

    void LockLayerInfo( struct Layer_Info *);

```
Links: [Layer_Info](_00C4) 

**FUNCTION**

Before doing an operation that requires the LayerInfo
structure, make sure that no other task is also using the
LayerInfo structure.  LockLayerInfo() returns when the
LayerInfo belongs to this task.  There should be
an [UnlockLayerInfo](_03A7) for every LockLayerInfo.

Note: All layer routines presently LockLayerInfo() when they
start up and [UnlockLayerInfo](_03A7) as they exit.  Programmers
will need to use these Lock/Unlock routines if they wish
to do something with the LayerStructure that is not
supported by the layer library.

**INPUTS**

li - pointer to [Layer_Info](_00C4) structure
