InstallLayerHook -- safely install a new Layer-&#062;BackFill hook.

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    oldhook = InstallLayerHook( layer, hook )
    d0                          a0     a1

    struct Hook *InstallLayerHook( struct Layer *, struct Hook *);

**FUNCTION**

Installs a new Layer-&#062;Backfill [Hook](_012D), waiting until it is safe to do
so. Locks the layer while substituting the new [Hook](_012D) and removing the
old one. If a new [Hook](_012D) is not provided, will install the default layer
BackFill [Hook](_012D).

**INPUTS**

layer - pointer to the layer in which to install the Backfill [Hook](_012D).
hook -  pointer to layer callback [Hook](_012D) which will be called
with object == (struct [RastPort](_00AF) *) result-&#062;RastPort
and message == [ (Layer *) layer, (struct Rectangle) bounds,
(WORD) offsetx, (WORD) offsety ]

This hook should fill the [Rectangle](_00A6) in the [RastPort](_00AF)
with the BackFill pattern appropriate for offset x/y.

If this hook pointer is NULL, the function installs
the &#034;default&#034; Layers BackFill [Hook](_012D) into this [Layer](_00A1).

**RESULTS**

oldhook - pointer to the Layer-&#062;BackFill [Hook](_012D) that was previously
active.
