**NAME**

InstallClipRegion -- Install clip region in layer

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    oldclipregion = InstallClipRegion( l,  region )
    d0                                 a0  a1

    struct Region *InstallClipRegion( struct Layer *, struct Region *);

```

**FUNCTION**

Installs a transparent Clip region in the layer. All
subsequent graphics calls will be clipped to this region.
You MUST remember to call InstallClipRegion(l,NULL) before
calling DeleteLayer(l) or the Intuition function [CloseWindow](CloseWindow)
if you have installed a non-NULL ClipRegion in l.

**INPUTS**

l - pointer to a layer
region - pointer to a region

**RESULTS**

oldclipregion - The pointer to the previous ClipRegion that
was installed. Returns NULL if no previous ClipRegion installed.

Note: If the system runs out of memory while computing the
resulting ClipRects the LAYERS_CLIPRECTS_LOST bit will
be set in l-&#062;Flags.

BUGS
If the system runs out of memory during normal layer operations,
the [ClipRect](_00A1) list may get swept away and not restored.
As soon as there is enough memory and the layer library
gets called again the [ClipRect](_00A1) list will be rebuilt.
